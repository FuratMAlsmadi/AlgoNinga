"""
The birthday paradox says that the probability that two people in a room
will have the same birthday is more than half, provided n, the number of
people in the room, is more than 23. This property is not really a paradox,
but many people Ô¨Ånd it surprising. Design a Python program that can test
this paradox by a series of experiments on randomly generated birthdays,
which test this paradox for n = 5, 10, 15, 20, . . . , 100.
